# SSI-app
Welcome to the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Mobile Application repository! This proof-of-concept, built with Dart and Flutter, demonstrates a decentralized identity management system. It integrates with a RESTful backend to enable secure credential management, selective disclosure, and QR-based sharing. Explore the screenshots below to see the app in action!

## Screenshots

### 1. Login Page

The main interface provides an overview of available credentials and management options, such as filtering by name, refreshing the page and importing new credentials by scanning QR codes.

### 3. Identifier
